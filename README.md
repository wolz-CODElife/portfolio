## Running locally in development mode 💻

To get started, just clone the repository and run `npm install && npm run dev`:

    git clone https://github.com/wolz-CODElife/portfolio.git
    npm install
    npm run dev

## Building and deploying in production 🚀

If you wanted to run this site in production, you should install modules then
build the site with `npm run build` and run it with `npm start`:

    npm install
    npm run build
    npm start

You should run `npm run build` again any time you make changes to the site.

Note: If you are already running a webserver on port 80 (e.g. Macs usually have
the Apache webserver running on port 80) you can still start the example in
production mode by passing a different port as an Environment Variable when
starting (e.g. `PORT=3000 npm start`).

### Alternate hosting options 🌍

You can host your Next.js site with any hosting provider. Although it works
great on Now, it also works great with other providers like Heroku, Amazon Web
Service, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, DigitalOcean and others.
